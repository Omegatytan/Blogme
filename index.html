        <!--First paragraph of the blog.-->
        Life started out difficult in 1995 when I was born. I opened my eyes to
        begin my life and slowly realized what an adventure this life would
        truly be. The first three years or so were fairly enjoyable. My father
        and mother mostly got along and I just played with toys and outside.
        Then life began to be a true journey. I remember my parents arguing and
        fighting constantly when I was three. They split, violently, and left me
        torn. I lived with my father for the rest of my fifteen years of life
        with visitation to my mother. Again, the first few years were great,
        until she got into drugs. Life began to be a series of events that left
        me not knowing where I was going to be sleeping, eating, or pretty much
        anything. After she left my step-father, when I was 15, life began to
        finally be stable.

        <!--This is the second paragraph and my current life.-->
        I met my wife at the young age of fifteen as well. We started dating and
        ended up getting married when I was twenty. We started our family at the
        age of twenty-one, and have two children now, four and one, with a third
        on the way. Mostly our hobbies at the moment include playing outside,
        shooting guns or bows, and riding off road vehicles. Now we just live
        life day by day, and enjoy our children.
